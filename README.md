# servermodscommand

## A simple mod to add a command to view all mods on the server.

Usage: 
 - `/mods` => View a list of (most) mods on the server.
 - `/mods all` => View a list of all mods on the server.
    - `/mods` will hide all mods developed by FabricMC or with the ID of `java` or `minecraft` to reduce clutter; `/mods all` shows all of them.
 - Hover over the mod in the list to see ID, version, description, and authors.
 - Click on a mod in the list or type `/mods details {modid}` to view further details.

Planned features:
 - Mods can customize what colour they appear as in the list
 - A config to hide mods from the list
